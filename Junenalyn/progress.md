## **Day 1 – Learning How I Can Use Git**

*February 22, 2026*



Today, my partner and I focused on learning how to use Git. Even though it was our first time actually downloading and using it, we were already somewhat familiar with it because our professor had previously taught us some basic Git commands in class. That background knowledge helped us feel less overwhelmed while starting out.



Even though we had heard about Git from our friends and classmates before, we had never fully explored GitHub on our own. At the beginning, there were still many new terms like repository, commit, push, and pull that we needed to understand more clearly. We reviewed what each command does and why version control is important in managing projects.



We created our first repository and practiced making commits. It was interesting to see how Git tracks changes in files and keeps a history of everything we do. I learned that commits are very helpful because they allow us to go back to previous versions if something goes wrong.



One important realization today was how useful Git is for teamwork. It makes collaboration easier and prevents people from accidentally overwriting each other’s work. Because we already had some basic knowledge from our professor, we were able to understand the workflow faster and feel more confident while practicing.



Overall, today was a productive introduction to using Git more seriously. Even though it was our first time officially using it, we did not feel completely lost because of the lessons we had before.



Tomorrow, we plan to:



Practice more Git commands

Create more folders for our Activity in Web System

Learn more about connecting a local project to GitHub
